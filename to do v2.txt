To do:

Write common functions for plotting (e.g. colorbar)

plot_before and plot_after in a plot function.
so
def plot(self, *args, **kwargs):
    plot_before()
    update_plots()
    plot_after()

Or better:
    plot_update()
    plot_draw()

A bunch of drawing things can go into plot_draw, esp. flush_events for non-notebook plotting

Reinstate _chan_labels as _daq_inputs and add _daq_outputs

Figure out notebook shared secret to avoid "untrusted" notebooks.

Add time estimates to procedures somehow

Connect to data server remotely.

**kwargs for everything - with warning for unused ones?
RC params

Figure out keyboard interrupt. I added this at the end of run(), but needs more testing.
if self.interrupt:
            raise KeyboardInterrupt # So we actually terminate with an interrupt.
