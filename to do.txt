Make load last plane a bit more seamless, need instruments
Allow for sig_in_ac_x = None

Implement namedtuple for piezos?

Fix attocube communication bug - delete object?

function in piezo that moves easily to point on a plane

Allow for voltage ranges on individual daq channels

Fix preamp timeout error

Allow for instruments = None to make an object with the same plotting, data saving/loading capabilities but without having to use the same instruments in two places


Save data while measurement in progress - test with mod2D?

When reading files that are open for writing, copy the file and load temp copy


Find location of Nowack_Lab module and figure out paths from there

directory_of_this_module = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))




Once have conversion factors, have touchdown "hone in" on center of piezo range better. Right now attocubes will miss.

	-If change direction multiple times, reduce attocube number of steps

Build in all conversion factors

Touchdown with floating table


In preamp driver (and others), only set values if they change

test daq sweep accel - kind of pointless right now, need to fix.

reset squid before each scan
 - auto reset? use subprocess?
	open = subprocess.Popen([‘python’, ‘somefile.py’]) #starts background process
	popen.kill() # when done

Array class that deals with pci, pfl.

-Auto tune function would be cool


Scanning procedure:

add squid relock

Figure out rates

Look at sweep rate as a function of number of points

Fine over one direction, coarse over other

	Change scan direction (arbitrary scan angle???)

Need to try swap as-is and go from there.

Would be good to get x/y straight when swapped vs not

Also would be good to “un-rotate” a scan to see which direction need to move with attocubes
