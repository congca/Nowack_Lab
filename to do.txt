Maybe take 4-5 points at a time for touchdown?

Allow for sig_in_ac_x = None


Fix attocube communication bug - delete object?

function in piezo that moves easily to point on a plane

Allow for voltage ranges on individual daq channels

Fix preamp timeout error

Allow for instruments = None to make an object with the same plotting, data saving/loading capabilities but without having to use the same instruments in two places


Save data while measurement in progress - test with mod2D?

When reading files that are open for writing, copy the file and load temp copy


Find location of Nowack_Lab module and figure out paths from there

directory_of_this_module = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))



Build in all conversion factors

Touchdown with floating table


In preamp driver (and others), only set values if they change

test daq sweep accel - kind of pointless right now, need to fix.

reset squid before each scan
 - auto reset? use subprocess?
	open = subprocess.Popen([‘python’, ‘somefile.py’]) #starts background process
	popen.kill() # when done

Array class that deals with pci, pfl.

-Auto tune function would be cool


Scanning procedure:

add squid relock

Figure out rates

Look at sweep rate as a function of number of points

Fine over one direction, coarse over other

	Change scan direction (arbitrary scan angle???)

Need to try swap as-is and go from there.

Would be good to get x/y straight when swapped vs not

Also would be good to “un-rotate” a scan to see which direction need to move with attocubes
